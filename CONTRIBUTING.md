You want to contribute to this project? Fantastic! However, before
you do, please read the following simple steps how to contribute.

## Discuss changes before implementing them

-   Open an issue in the repository, using the [bug tracker][1]. Please
    describe the contribution you would like to make, the bug you found or any
    other ideas you have. This will help us to understand your request.

-   Add the platform and software information (e.g. operating
    system, Node.JS version etc.) and in case of errors details error messages
    and/or screenshots.

-   It is recommended to wait for feedback before continuing to next steps, unless
    the issue is clear (e.g. a typo) and the fix is simple. In this case, you can
    continue and fix it.

## Fixing issues

-   Fork the project in your account and create a branch with your fix:
    `my-next-feature` or `some-bug-fix`.

-   Commit your changes in that branch.

-   Add yourself to the `contributors` array of the `package.json` file:

    ```json
    {
        "contributors": ["Your Name <and@email.address> (http://your.website)"]
    }
    ```

## Creating a pull request

-   Open a pull request, and reference the initial issue in the pull request
    message (e.g. _fixes #<your-issue-number>_). Write a good description and
    title, so everybody will know what is fixed/improved.

-   If it makes sense, add screenshots, gifs etc., so it is easier to see what
    is going on.

## Wait for feedback

Before accepting your contributions, we will review them. You may get feedback
about what should be fixed in your modified code. If so, just keep committing
in your branch and the pull request will be updated automatically.

## Merging the contribution

In the final step, your contributions will hopefully be merged with the project.

Contributions are more than welcome!

Thanks!
